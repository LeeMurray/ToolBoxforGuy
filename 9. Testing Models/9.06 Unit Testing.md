# Unit Testing

Unit testing is the first level of testing and is often performed by the developers themselves. It is the process of ensuring individual components of a piece of software at the code level are functional and work as they were designed to. Developers in a test-driven environment will typically write and run the tests prior to the software or feature being passed over to the test team. Unit testing can be conducted manually, but automating the process will speed up delivery cycles and expand test coverage. Unit testing will also make debugging easier because finding issues earlier means they take less time to fix than if they were discovered later in the testing process. TestLeft is a tool that allows advanced testers and developers to shift left with the fastest test automation tool embedded in any IDE.
