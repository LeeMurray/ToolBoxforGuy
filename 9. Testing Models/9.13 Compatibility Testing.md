# Compatibility Testing

Compatibility testing is used to gauge how an application or piece of software will work in different environments. It is used to check that your product is compatible with multiple operating systems, platforms, browsers, or resolution configurations. The goal is to ensure that your softwareâ€™s functionality is consistently supported across any environment you expect your end users to be using.
