# Usability Testing

Usability testing is a testing method that measures an applicationâ€™s ease-of-use from the end-user perspective and is often performed during the system or acceptance testing stages. The goal is to determine whether or not the visible design and aesthetics of an application meet the intended workflow for various processes, such as logging into an application. Usability testing is a great way for teams to review separate functions, or the system as a whole, is intuitive to use.
