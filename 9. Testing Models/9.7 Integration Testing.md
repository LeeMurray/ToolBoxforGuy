# Integration Testing

After each unit is thoroughly tested, it is integrated with other units to create modules or components that are designed to perform specific tasks or activities. These are then tested as group through integration testing to ensure whole segments of an application behave as expected (i.e, the interactions between units are seamless). These tests are often framed by user scenarios, such as logging into an application or opening files. Integrated tests can be conducted by either developers or independent testers and are usually comprised of a combination of automated functional and manual tests.
