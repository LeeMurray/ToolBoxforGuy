# Security Testing

With the rise of cloud-based testing platforms and cyber attacks, there is a growing concern and need for the security of data being used and stored in software. Security testing is a non-functional software testing technique used to determine if the information and data in a system is protected. The goal is to purposefully find loopholes and security risks in the system that could result in unauthorized access to or the loss of information by probing the application for weaknesses. There are multiple types of this testing method, each of which aimed at verifying six basic principles of security: 
- Integrity 
- Confidentiality 
- Authentication 
- Authorization 
- Availability 
- Non-repudiation
