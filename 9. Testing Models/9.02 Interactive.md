## What is it? 
In this model, a big project is divided into small parts, and each part is subjected to multiple iterations of the waterfall model. At the end of an iteration, a new module is developed or an existing module is enhanced. This module is integrated into the software architecture and the entire system is tested all together  

## What is the testing Approach? 
As soon as iteration is completed, the entire system is subjected to testing. Feedback from testing is immediately available and is incorporated in the next cycle. The testing time required in successive iteration can be reduced based on the experience gained from past iterations. 

### Advantages 
The main advantage of iterative development is the test feedback is immediately available at the end of each cycle. 

## Disadvantages 
This model increases communication overheads significantly since, at the end of each cycle, feedback about deliverables, effort etc must be given
