# Functional vs. Non-functional
The goal of utilizing numerous testing methodologies in your development process is to make sure your software can successfully operate in multiple environments and across different platforms. These can typically be broken down between functional and non-functional testing. Functional testing involves testing the application against the business requirements. It incorporates all test types designed to guarantee each part of a piece of software behaves as expected by using uses cases provided by the design team or business analyst. These testing methods are usually conducted in order and include: 
* Unit testing 
* Integration testing 
* System testing 
* Acceptance testing 
Non-functional testing methods incorporate all test types focused on the operational aspects of a piece of software. These include: 
* Performance testing 
* Security testing 
* Usability testing 
* Compatibility testing 
The key to releasing high quality software that can be easily adopted by your end users is to build a robust testing framework that implements both functional and non-functional software testing methodologies.
