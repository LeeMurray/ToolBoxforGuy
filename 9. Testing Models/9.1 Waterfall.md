# Waterfall

## What is it? 
In the waterfall model, software development progress through various phases like Requirements Analysis, Design etc -  **sequentially.**
In this model, the next phase begins only when the earlier phase is completed. 

## What Is The Testing Approach? 
The first phase in the waterfall model is the requirements phase in which all the project requirements are completely defined before starting the testing. During this phase, the test team brainstorms the scope of testing, test strategy and drafts a detailed test plan. 

Only once the design of software is complete, the team will move on to execution of the test cases to ensure that the developed software behaves as it expected. 

In this methodology, the testing team proceeds to the next phase only when the previous phase is completed. 

## Advantages 
This software Engineering model is very simple to plan and manage. Hence, projects, where requirements are clearly defined and stated beforehand, can be easily tested using a waterfall model.  

## Disadvantages 

In the waterfall model, you can begin with the next phase only once the previous phase is completed. Hence, this model cannot accommodate unplanned events and uncertainty. 

This methodology is not suitable for projects where the requirements change frequently.
