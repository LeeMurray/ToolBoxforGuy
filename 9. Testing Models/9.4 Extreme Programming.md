## What is it? 
Extreme programming is a type of agile methodology which beliefs in short development cycles. A project is divided into simple engineering tasks. Programmers code a simple piece of software and get back to the customer for feedback. Review points from the customer are incorporated and the developers proceed with the next task. 
In extreme programming developers usually, work in pairs. 
Extreme Programming is used in places where customer requirements are constantly changing. 

## What Is The Testing Approach? 
Extreme programming follows a Test-driven development which is described as follows - 
1. Add a Test Case to the test suite  to verify the new functionality which is yet to be developed 
2. Run all the tests and obviously the new test case added must fail since the functionality is not coded yet 
3. Write some code to implement the feature/functionality 
4. Run the test suite again. This time, the new test case should pass since the functionally has been coded 

## Advantages 
Customers having a  vague software design in mind could use extreme programming 
Continuous testing and continuous integration of small releases ensure software code is delivered is of high quality 

### Disadvantages 
Meetings amongst the software development team and clients add to time requirements.
