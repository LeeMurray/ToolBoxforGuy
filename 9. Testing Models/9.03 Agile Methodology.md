## What is it? 
Traditional software development methodologies work on the premise that software requirements remain constant throughout the project. But with an increase in complexity, the requirements undergo numerous changes and continuously evolve. At times, the customer himself is not sure what he wants. Though the iterative model addresses this issue, it's still based on the waterfall model. 

In Agile methodology, software is developed in incremental, rapid cycles. Interactions amongst customers, developers and client are emphasized rather than processes and tools. The agile methodology focuses on responding to change rather than extensive planning. 

## What Is The Testing Approach? 
Incremental testing is used in agile development methods and hence, every release of the project is tested thoroughly. This ensures that any bugs in the system are fixed before the next release. 

## Advantages 
It is possible to make changes in the project at any time to comply with the requirements. 
This incremental testing minimizes risks. 

## Disadvantages 
Constant client interaction means added time pressure on all stakeholders including the client themselves, software development and test teams.
