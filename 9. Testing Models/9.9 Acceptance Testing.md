# Acceptance Testing

Acceptance testing is the last phase of functional testing and is used to assess whether or not the final piece of software is ready for delivery. It involves ensuring that the product is in compliance with all of the original business criteria and that it meets the end user’s needs. This requires the product be tested both internally and externally, meaning you’ll need to get it into the hands of your end users for beta testing along with those of your QA team. Beta testing is key to getting real feedback from potential customers and can address any final usability concerns.
