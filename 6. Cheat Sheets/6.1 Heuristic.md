## Testing Wisdom

- A test is an experiment designed to reveal information or answer a specific question about the software or system. 
- Stakeholders have questions; testers have answers 
- Don't confuse speed with progress 
- Take a contrary approach 
- Observation is exploratory 
- The narrower the view, the wider the ignorance 
- Big bugs are often found by coincidence 
- Bugs cluster
- Vary sequences, configurations and data to increase the probability that, if there is a problem, testing will find it 
- It's all about the variables 

## Heuristics

Name | Notes
--- | ---
Variable Analysis | Identify anything whose value can change. Variables can be obvious, subtle or hidden. 
Touch Points  | Identify and public or private interface that provides visibility or control. Provides places to provoke, monitor and verify the system. 
Boundaries | Approaching the boundary (All most too big, almost too small) at the boundary 
Goldilocks | Too Big, Too Small, Just Right 
CRUD | Create, Read, Update, Delete 
Follow the Data | Perform a sequence of actions involving data, verifying the data integrity at each step. (Example: Enter > Search > Report > Export > Import > Update > View) 
Configurations | Varying the Variables related to configuration (Screen Resolution; Network Speed, Latency, Signal Strength; Memory; Disk Availability  Count heuristic applied to any peripheral such as 0, 1, Many Monitors, Mice, Or Printers) 
Interruptions | Log Off, Shut Down, Reboot, Kill Process, Disconnect, Hibernate, Timeout, Cancel 
Starvation | CPU, Memory, Network or Disk at maximum capacity 
Position | Beginning, Middle, End (Edit at the beginning of the line, middle of the line, end of the line) 
Selection | Some, None, All (Some permissions, No permissions, All permissions) 
Count | 0, 1, Many (0 transactions, 1 transactions, Many simultaneous transactions) 
Multi-User | Simultaneous create, Update, Delete from two accounts or same account logged in twice  
Flood | Multiple simultaneous transactions or requests flooding the queue 
Dependencies | Identify 'has a' relationship (A customer has an invoice; an Invoice has multiple line items). Apply CRUD, Count, Position and/or Selection heuristics (Customer has 0, 1, many invoices; Invoice has 0, 1, many line items; Delete last line item then read; Update first line item; Some, None, All line items are taxable; Delete Customer with 0, 1, Many Invoices) 
Constraints | Violate constraints (Leave required fields blank, Enter invalid combinations in dependent fields, enter duplicate ID's or Names) Apply with the Input Method heuristic 
Input Method | Typing, Copy/Paste, Import, Drag/Drop, Various Interfaces (GUI vs API) 
Sequences | Vary Order of Operations, Undo/Redo, Reverse, Combine, Invert, Simultaneous 
Sorting | Alpha vs Numeric, Across Multiple Pages 
State Analysis | Identify states and events/transactions, then represent then in a picture or table. Work with the Sequences and  Interruption heuristic. 
Map Making | Identify a 'base' or 'home' state. Pick a direction and take one step. Return to base. Repeat. 
User & Scenarios | Use Cases, Soap Operas, Personae, Extreme Personalities 

## Frameworks
Name | Notes
--- | ---
Judgement | Inconsistencies, Absences and Extras with respect to Internal, External - Specific, or External - Cultural references points. 
Observations | Input/Output/Linkage 
Flow | Input/Processing/Output 
Requirements | User/Functions/Attributes/Constraints 
Nouns & Verbs | The object or data in the system and the ways in which the system manipulaites it. Also, adjectives (attributes) such as Visible, Identical, Verbose and Adverbs (action descriptors) such as Quickly, Slowly, Repeatedly, Precisely, Randomly. Good for creating random scenarios 
Deming's Cycle | Plan, Do, Check, Act
